# sBTC Payment Gateway Architecture

## Overview

The sBTC Payment Gateway is designed as a secure and efficient payment processing system for handling sBTC transactions on the Stacks blockchain. This document outlines the architectural decisions, components, and their interactions.

## Core Components

### 1. Merchant Management

```
merchants: Map(principal -> MerchantData)
```

- Stores merchant information
- Handles registration and status
- Manages withdrawal addresses
- Tracks merchant-specific metrics

### 2. Payment Processing

```
payments: Map(uint -> PaymentData)
```

- Creates and processes payments
- Handles payment lifecycle
- Manages payment status
- Tracks payment metadata

### 3. Balance Management

```
merchant-balances: Map(principal -> uint)
```

- Tracks merchant balances
- Handles fee calculations
- Manages withdrawals

## Data Structures

### Merchant Data

```clarity
{
    active: bool,
    total-volume: uint,
    payment-count: uint,
    withdrawal-address: (optional principal),
    fee-override: (optional uint)
}
```

### Payment Data

```clarity
{
    merchant: principal,
    amount: uint,
    customer: principal,
    status: (string-ascii 20),
    created-at: uint,
    processed-at: (optional uint),
    reference: (optional (string-ascii 64))
}
```

## Security Model

1. **Access Control**

   - Contract owner privileges
   - Merchant authentication
   - Customer verification

2. **Fee Management**

   - Global fee configuration
   - Merchant-specific overrides
   - Fee limits and validation

3. **Balance Security**
   - Secure withdrawal system
   - Balance tracking
   - Transaction validation

## Flow Diagrams

### Payment Processing Flow

```
Customer -> Create Payment -> Validate -> Process -> Update Balances -> Complete
```

### Withdrawal Flow

```
Merchant -> Request Withdrawal -> Validate Balance -> Process Transfer -> Update State
```

## Error Handling

The contract uses specific error codes for different scenarios:

- ERR_NOT_AUTHORIZED (u100)
- ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT (u101)
- ERR_PAYMENT_NOT_FOUND (u102)
- etc.

## Design Decisions

1. **Why Map Storage?**

   - Efficient key-value storage
   - Easy to update and query
   - Natural fit for business entities

2. **Fee Structure**

   - Basis points for precision
   - Configurable per merchant
   - Global defaults

3. **Status Management**
   - String-based status
   - Optional timestamps
   - Clear state transitions

## Performance Considerations

1. **Storage Optimization**

   - Minimal data structures
   - Optional fields where appropriate
   - Efficient data types

2. **Computation Efficiency**
   - Simple fee calculations
   - Minimal state changes
   - Optimized validations

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**

   - Batch processing
   - Payment streaming
   - Advanced fee models

2. **Features**

   - Dispute resolution
   - Automated settlements
   - Enhanced reporting

3. **Integration**
   - Oracle support
   - Cross-chain compatibility
   - Advanced analytics
